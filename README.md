# Social Media Marketing Analytics: Scale vs Engagement Efficiency

## Overview
This project analyzes social media post performance to evaluate whether higher reach translates into meaningful and quantified engagement. The analysis focuses on content type and paid vs organic distribution types to separate vanity metrics from engagement efficiency.

## Business Questions
- Do paid posts drive more engagement or primarily scale reach?
- Which content formats generate higher engagement efficiency?
- When does paid amplification improve or dilute performance by content type?

## Data
- Facebook post-level engagement data (likes, comments, shares, reach, impressions)
- Each row represents a single post - This is the grain of the data

## Key Metrics
- **Total Engagement** = Likes + Comments + Shares  
- **Engagement Rate** = Total Engagement ÷ Reach  
- Reach and impressions used as contextual metrics

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas) for data cleaning and KPI creation
- Tableau Public for visualization and storytelling

## Key Insights
- Paid promotion significantly increases reach, but organic posts consistently show higher engagement efficiency.
- Engagement performance varies more by content type than by paid vs organic distribution alone. Photos, among content types seems to have the highest engagement efficiency.
- Paid amplification does not uniformly improve engagement across all content formats, indicating the need for selective promotion strategies.

## Takeaway
Content quality and format should be prioritized before amplification. Paid promotion is most effective when applied selectively to content types that already demonstrate strong organic engagement.
